## Disclaimer

I made this plugin just for fun and because I thought it would be handy to have a plugin like that. Therefore, it is released under MIT license. Do whatever you want with it, but it comes without warranty or liability of any kind.

However, an acknowledgement would be nice.

## Feature & Pull Requests

Feel free to request features, but my time is very limited. So it is unlikely that any new features will be added in the future. If you want to contribute and add features yourself, feel free to create a PR. I'll review and merge if it makes the plugin any better!

## Acknowledgements

This plugin is based on the [elgato plugin template](https://github.com/elgatosf/streamdeck-plugintemplate).
The clock calculation and drawing routine is inspired by [this kirupa tutorial](https://www.kirupa.com/html5/create_an_analog_clock_using_the_canvas.htm).
